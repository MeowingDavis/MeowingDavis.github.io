        <p id="feedback">FEEDBACK:An engaging soundtrack which works well with the sound design elements.<br>
            As discussed in class, articulating the morphs throughout (the way you started at :31) <br>
            would have made the experience more compelling. Would have been good to bring in more creative references as well as academic resources<br>
             which speak more directly to the larger idea you're undertaking. </p>

        <h4>Weekly thought</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Do less.. having 45 tracks is no more useful then 1 if the same message is conveyed</p>
